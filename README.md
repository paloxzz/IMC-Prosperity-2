## Our Experience
The Prosperity2 challenge was intense yet rewarding. Each challenge brought a new set of hurdles that required us to adapt and innovate. Below, we've outlined our experiences with each challenge, detailing how we approached them, the strategies we used, and the lessons we learned along the way.

## Round 1
### Algorithm Challenge

**Objective:**  
In this round, we were introduced to the first two tradable products: `STARFRUIT` and `AMETHYSTS`. While the value of `AMETHYSTS` has historically remained stable, the value of `STARFRUIT` fluctuates over time. Our task was to develop an initial trading strategy and write a Python program to effectively trade and market make these products, despite their differing price behaviors.

**Position Limits:**
- `STARFRUIT`: 20
- `AMETHYSTS`: 20

**Our Approach:**  
In Round 1, our team focused on a market-making strategy that involved dynamically managing trades around Fair Value (FV) updates, inventory control, and price prediction models. The strategy was tailored to different products based on their unique characteristics: **AMETHYSTS** with a stable approach and **STARFRUIT** with a dynamic, trend-driven approach.

#### Key Components

1. **Fair Value (FV) Updates**
   - We regularly updated the fair value of the products based on current market conditions, ensuring that we were trading at or near the most accurate price levels.

2. **Executing Scratches**
   - We performed market-taking actions when orders were under or near FV, avoiding transactions at the worst bid/ask levels to minimize risk.

3. **Stop Loss Implementation**
   - Trading was halted when inventory levels exceeded a predefined limit. This ensured that stop loss actions were not triggered at unfavorable bid/ask levels, protecting against large losses.

4. **Market Making Around FV**
   - We engaged in market making near the fair value, adjusting the maximum trade amounts based on inventory levels and the size of order skew to maintain optimal liquidity without overexposure.

#### AMETHYSTS: A Stable Approach

AMETHYSTS had a well-established fair value of **10,000 units**, with minimal fluctuations (Â±2). Given this stability, we applied our market-making strategy with minimal adjustments to the fair value.

- **Fair Value Stability**: The stable FV allowed for straightforward market making, with liquidity provision around the 10,000 mark.
- **Minimal Fluctuations**: We capitalized on the minor variations by placing strategic bid/ask orders to maximize profits from small price changes.

#### STARFRUIT: A Dynamic Approach

STARFRUIT exhibited strong trends with potential for daily reversals. To account for this volatility, we implemented a **rolling linear regression model** to predict price movements.

#### Price Prediction Model

We modeled the price using linear regression:
- **Formula**: 
  $P_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t$

- **Prediction**: 
  $\hat{P}_{t+1} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}(t+1)$

#### SOBI (Static Order Book Imbalance)

To reduce noise and avoid biases from small bid/ask spreads, we incorporated the **mid-volume weighted average price (VWAP)** from the order book instead of relying solely on the midprice.

#### Optimizing the Rolling Window

To enhance accuracy, we evaluated various rolling window sizes using **heatmaps** to identify the optimal window size for precise price predictions.

#### Market Making vs. Market Taking

- **Market Making**: Involves placing buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders at various price levels to provide liquidity without the intent of immediate execution.
  
- **Market Taking**: Focuses on executing trades by matching orders with existing ones in the order book to fill positions quickly, regardless of price levels.

#### Conclusion

By tailoring our approach to each product, we balanced stability with dynamic trading strategies, enabling us to maximize profits while minimizing risks. Our market-making framework proved effective for AMETHYSTS' stable environment and adaptive enough to handle STARFRUIT's volatility.

### Manual Challenge

**Objective:**  
In this challenge, we were given two opportunities to bid on `SCUBA_GEAR`, which we could later sell for 1000 SeaShells each. The goldfish we were trading with would accept the lowest bid that exceeded their reserve price, which varied between 900 and 1000 SeaShells, with higher prices being more likely.

**Our Approach:**  
- **Bidding Strategy:** Knowing that the reserve price distribution was skewed towards 1000, we decided to place our bids close to the higher end of the range. Our first bid was set just above the median of the distribution, and our second bid was placed significantly higher to maximize the chance of acceptance.
- **Risk Management:** We balanced the need to make competitive bids with the desire to maximize our profit margin by carefully calculating the probability of each bid being accepted.

## Round 2:
### Algorithm Challenge
**Objective:**  
In this round, we continued trading the products introduced in Round 1 (`STARFRUIT` and `AMETHYSTS`), while also being introduced to a new product: `ORCHIDS`. The value of `ORCHIDS` was influenced by various observable factors, such as hours of sunlight, humidity, shipping costs, tariffs, and storage capacity. Our task was to optimize our trading algorithm by identifying the connections between these factors and the price of `ORCHIDS`.

**Position Limits:**
- `ORCHIDS`: 100

**Our Approach:**  

### Manual Challenge

**Objective:**  
The manual challenge this round involved a series of foreign currency trades. We started by converting our SeaShells into a foreign currency and ended with a final conversion back into SeaShells. The challenge was to determine the optimal series of trades in between that would maximize our final holdings of SeaShells.


## Round 3:
### Algorithm Challenge
**Objective:**  
In Round 3, we were introduced to a new product: the `GIFT_BASKET`, which contains four `CHOCOLATE` bars, six `STRAWBERRIES`, and a single `ROSES`. These items, along with the products from the previous rounds (`STARFRUIT`, `AMETHYSTS`, `ORCHIDS`), could all be traded on the island exchange. Our task was to determine whether it was more profitable to trade the `GIFT_BASKET` as a whole or to sell its individual contents separately.

**Position Limits:**
- `CHOCOLATE`: 250
- `STRAWBERRIES`: 350
- `ROSES`: 60
- `GIFT_BASKET`: 60

**Our Approach:**  
- **Spread Trading**: Focused on trading the spread between the Gift Basket and its underlying components.
  - **Spread Formula**: `Spread = Basket Price - Synthetic Price (sum of components)`
  - **Key Hypotheses**:
    1. **Leading/Lagging Relationships**: Explored whether the synthetic prices or basket prices led the other in market movement.
    2. **Mean Reversion**: Investigated if the spread between basket and synthetic prices exhibited mean-reverting behavior.

#### Observations:
- Historical data showed that the spread price oscillated around ~368.
- **Adopted a Mean-Reversion Strategy**:
  - **Buy Spreads**: When the spread price was below the historical average.
  - **Sell Spreads**: When the spread price was above the historical average.

#### Challenges:
- **Position Limits**: Restricted the number of trades and opportunities to exploit market inefficiencies.
- **Timing Trades**: Crucial to avoid missing opportunities for mean reversion due to sudden price shifts.

#### Improved Strategy:
- **Adaptive Z-Score Trading Approach**:
  - **Z-Score Calculation**: Used a modified z-score based approach to evaluate whether the GIFT_BASKET was overvalued (z_score_diff > 2) or undervalued (z_score_diff < -2).
  - **Rolling Window**: A smaller rolling window was implemented to capture volatility spikes, which enabled more precise trading near local minima and maxima.

#### Outcome:
- The modified strategy improved the accuracy of trades by accounting for sudden volatility.
- **Drawbacks**: The strategy struggled in scenarios where volatility spikes coincided with overall downtrends, leading to misaligned trades during market corrections.

### Manual Challenge

**Objective:**  
In this challenge, we were tasked with embarking on up to three treasure-hunting expeditions, each with a potential reward based on the **treasure multiplier** and the number of **hunters** in the same spot. The challenge was to maximize our profit while balancing the cost of additional expeditions and the competition from other players.
  
## Round 4:

### Algorithm Challenge

**Objective:**  
Round 4 introduced a new product: the `COCONUT_COUPON`. These coupons granted the right to buy `COCONUT` at a fixed price of 10,000 SeaShells after 250 trading days. Our challenge was to trade these coupons as a separate asset while predicting whether it would be more profitable to exercise the coupons and buy the actual `COCONUT` at the end of the period.

**Position Limits:**
- `COCONUT`: 300
- `COCONUT_COUPON`: 600

#### Vega Explained:
- **Vega** is the measurement of an option's price sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset.

#### Underlying Assets:
- **COCONUT**: The base asset.
- **COCONUT_COUPON**: European call option with a strike price of 10,000 and a time to maturity of 250 days.

#### Strategy:
- **Focus**: Vega trading, primarily exploiting changes in implied volatility (IV) in the market.
- **IV Calculation**: Used the Black-Scholes model to compute implied volatility.
  - **Observations**: IV oscillated around ~16%, showing strong intraday mean-reverting behavior.

#### Trading Approach:
1. **Initial Strategy: Pyramid-Style Grid Trading**:
   - **Concept**: Increased position size progressively as IV deviated from its average.
   - **Challenges**: Weaker mean-reversion signals at lower z-scores made the approach less effective.
   
2. **Modified Strategy: Trapezoid-Style Grid Trading**:
   - **Avoided Trades**: Below a certain z-score threshold, trades were skipped to avoid low-confidence opportunities.
   - **Successful Trade Zones**: Found that going all-in near a z-score of 1.5 yielded the most profitable trades.

#### Challenges:
- **Delta-Hedging**: Initially employed delta-hedging to minimize risk, but this approach led to losses.

#### Further Trials:
- Explored various alternative hedging techniques, including:
  - **Naked Trading**: Avoided hedging altogether.
  - **Flipped Hedge Strategy**: Switched the hedge based on IV levels.
  
#### Conclusion:
- **Final Approach**: Flipped the hedge, making trading decisions based on underlying asset signals influenced by IV. This adaptive method proved more effective at capitalizing on market volatility.

### Manual Challenge

**Objective:**  
In this challenge, we were again bidding on `SCUBA_GEAR`, but with a twist. This time, the second bid also considered the average second bid of all other traders in the archipelago. If our second bid was under the average, our probability of securing a deal decreased based on a scaling factor, adding a dynamic element to our bidding strategy.

## Round 5:

### Algorithm Challenge

**Objective:**  
In the final round, no new products were introduced, but we gained access to valuable information: the `counter_party` in each trade. This allowed us to see who we were trading against, presenting an opportunity to further refine our algorithm and potentially increase profitability by leveraging counterparty behavior.

**Approach:**
Through the data colleced from the counter parties, various conditions can be made for different assets as each counter party had a unique behavior with a certain asset like buying high/low and selling low/high for coconuts, etc., which could easily be identified by plotting the data for visual representation.
However we were not able to implement the updates due to our university term examinations and thus missed the algo trading round

### Manual Challenge

**Objective:**  
In the final challenge, we were invited to trade foreign goods on the Northern Archipelago. The penguinsâ trusted news source, Iceberg, provided us with critical market information, but we also had to manage the increasing costs of trading each good as we conducted more trades.

**Our Approach:**  
- **News Analysis:** Using insights from the Iceberg news source, we identified key trends and market movements in the Northern Archipelago. This allowed us to make informed decisions about which foreign goods to trade, timing our entries and exits for maximum impact.
- **Profitability Check:** We employed Monte Carlo simulations to assess the profitability of each trade. 
- **Selective Trading:** Rather than engaging in broad trading across all goods, we focused on a few high-margin opportunities, ensuring that the rising costs did not erode our profits.


## Results
### Final Rank: 219th overall, 13th in India.
